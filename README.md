# ShuddhYogasana
**ShuddhYogasana: Yoga Pose Classifier** - an innovative deep learning project. It identifies and classifies yoga poses with precision, using Mediapipe for pose detection and a Keras Dense network for reliable predictions.  ShuddhYogasana delivers reliable predictions for an enhanced yoga experience. As yoga is all about harmony and precision.

**ShuddhYogasana** combines two words: "Shuddh," which is a Sanskrit word meaning "pure" or "clean," and "Yogasana," which refers to yoga poses. Together, "ShuddhYogasana" conveys the idea of purity or clarity in identifying and classifying yoga poses accurately.
